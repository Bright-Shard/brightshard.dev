<h1 class="code">About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a teenage programmer and hacker. I have lots of experience in
    Python, CSS, HTML, and Roblox scripting; moderate experience in JavaScript; as well as a bit of experience with C#
    in Unity and C in Arduino. I'm also an ethical hacker, but I don't have as much experience with hacking as I do
    programming. Some of my projects are showcased on this website, which I programmed myself from the ground up!</p>

<h1 class="code">How to Contribute</h1>
<p>You can contribute to my projects whether you know how to program or not. If you know how to program, all of my apps
    are open-source on <a href="https://github.com/Bright-Shard" target="_blank">my GitHub page</a>, so you can just add
    features to the code directly. Otherwise, you can contact me about an issue or feature you want added - either by
    contacting me personally, or by raising an issue on the GitHub page of the app you want to contribute to.</p>
